# Summary {#summary}

Over the 8 weeks of the course, I conducted several personal practice interviews and case work activities. In the personal practice, I experimented with different interview techniques with varying degrees of body language and tone. As an experiment of my own choice, I compared the results of a survey and interview with a team member. For the literature study, I focused on the topic "Requirements Engineering in Agile Project".

In the case work, our team worked on the "Find the Right Present" case, where we had to engineer the requirements for a system that helps people to find the right present for someone. To understand the user needs better, we conducted stakeholder interviews, market research. With the insights from our collected data and research about the psychology of gift giving, we could design a prototype solution that was proposed to the client in the final presentation.

In the first week we started practicing simple interviews. At first we conducted 4 short interviews where we could get used to interviewing and get to know our team members better. Later, we added 2 more substantial interviews that were also video recorded and we actively experimented with some interview techniques.

We also started to work on the case by setting up a kick-off interview with the client.

## Personal Practice Interviews (5 hours) {#personal-practice-interviews-(5-hours)}

As a warmup, we started with short interviews to get to know each other better and get a feeling for the interview process. In the two longer interviews, we added some experiments to improve our interviewing skills.

### Yutong (short interview) {#yutong-(short-interview)}

Duration: 5min

Focus: What is a good team member

Notes:

- I was still nervous about interviewing in general as it was my first time and wasn't prepared for the interview.  
- Had difficulties in what kind of questions to ask.

### Ilia (short interview) {#ilia-(short-interview)}

Duration: 5min

Focus: What is a good team member

Notes:

- Tried to make the interviewee speak by asking for real life experience.

### Guillermo (short interview) {#guillermo-(short-interview)}

Duration: 5min

Focus: What is a good team member

Notes:

- As it was difficult to get straight into the topic, I started the interview by adding an intro talk.  
- For example, giving examples of core team member values such as punctuality and humbleness.

### Kyle (short interview) {#kyle-(short-interview)}

Duration: 5min

Focus: What is a good team member

Notes:

- Suggested interviewee to elaborate on thoughts by summarizing and adding my interpretations.  
- Asked about examples in the past.

### Ada (long interview) {#ada-(long-interview)}

Duration: 13min

Focus: What is a good team member

Video Recording: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ewFtflduAXXvuBhERcATI5Zxq4LUPr6k/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ewFtflduAXXvuBhERcATI5Zxq4LUPr6k/view?usp=sharing)

#### Experiments: {#experiments:}

- Since there is more time, I tried get into the topic by firstly making general questions about the interviewees background and her experience with team work to break the ice and get to know the interviewee  
  - For example, asking about the interviewees past project she has been involved in (0:30)  
- Based on the background of the interviewee I could make the interviewee elaborate on her values backed with real life examples  
  - Didn’t just focus on good examples but also asked about negative examples in the past that backed up the interviewees reasons (7:00)  
- Made short summaries of the interviewees answers to make sure I understood the interviewee correctly (8:30)

Self reflection after reviewing the video:

- Often avoided eye contact due to nervousness and struggling to find the right questions.  
  - Especially when I was thinking about the next question I was not looking at the interviewee  
- I was concerned too much about time keeping. I should have been more present in the moment and focused on the interviewee.  
- During the interview I got into the flow and was more relaxed towards the end of the interview also thanks to Ada. I was able to get a good understanding of the interviewee and her values about teamwork.

### Tom (long interview) {#tom-(long-interview)}

Duration: 12min

Focus: What is a good team member

Video Recording: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-8loB8RHAX\_mBngdIF2KAxQteJYmIkcp/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-8loB8RHAX_mBngdIF2KAxQteJYmIkcp/view?usp=sharing)

#### Experiments: {#experiments:-1}

- Went with a similar approach to Ada’s interview  
- As the interviewee was sometimes vague with his answers I tried to get more information by rephrasing and directing the question to a specific point (5:30)  
- Asked follow up questions that are relative to the expectations that the interviewee has. E.g. why a team member would have less value if the expected skill set in a team is high, compared to values that are important if the expected skill set is low. (8:30)  
- Tried to be more present by doing more active listening like nodding or repeating what the interviewee said to show that I am listening.

#### Evaluation {#evaluation}

- Still struggling with eye contact and finding the right questions.  
- The active listening was better than in the previous interview and I was able to make the interviewee talk.  
- I asked some questions that were a bit too hard to understand and caused some confusion. I should have been more clear with my questions.

## Case Work (3 hours) {#case-work-(3-hours)}

After a discussion with our team members, we voted for the "Find the right present" case as our first choice. We then set up a kick-off interview with the client. The kickoff-interview has been initiated by sending an outreach email to the client. The email contained a brief introduction of the team and the purpose of the interview.

Finally, we discussed which role each team member would take in the case and what kind of questions we would ask in the upcoming interviews. I was assigned the role of the backup interviewer to support the main interviewer in the interviews. It could happen that the interview questions derail and the backup interviewer can step in to get the interview back on track.

# Week 2 {#week-2-1}

In the second week, we reflected on the last week's interviews and added new techniques to our interviews to make the interviewee feel more at ease. In the interview, we role played as me being a personal shopper someone who is looking for a new phone.  
For the case, we conducted the kick-off interview with the client and started to work on the case by setting up a plan for the following weeks.

## Personal Practice (5 hours) {#personal-practice-(5-hours)}

During this interview session, I implemented a technique that allows the interviewee to feel more at ease. As an experiment, I used a body language that was more open and inviting which let the interviewee feel more comfortable to talk about their experiences. Further details can be found in the Experiments section in the interview with Yvo.

As a warmup I started with an unrecorded interview with Jakub. We then conducted a recorded interview with Ivo where we experimented with the body language techniques.

### Interview with Jakub {#interview-with-jakub}

Duration: 5min

Focus: Personal shopper for a new phone

Notes:

- It was a warm up interview to get used to the new techniques.  
- I tried to use an open body language to express a more open and inviting atmosphere.  
- Based on the feedback from previous sessions, I tried to make more eye contact and not to look away while thinking about the next question.

### Interview with Yvo {#interview-with-yvo}

Duration: 5min

Focus: Personal shopper for a new phone

Video Recording: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yYHwnTIAp7XYSwSo1HTqcZf3Xwtg6EhC/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yYHwnTIAp7XYSwSo1HTqcZf3Xwtg6EhC/view?usp=sharing)

### Experiments {#experiments-4}

[Research from Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/news/2013/01/15/dont-read-my-lips-body-language-trumps-face-conveying-intense-emotions) \[1\] shows that body language is a key factor in communication and conveys emotions more effectively than facial expressions. In experiments of the research, participants were better at identifying emotions based solely on body language compared to facial cues, suggesting that body movements carry substantial communicative weight in social interactions.

- Same as Jakub, I tried to use an open body language to express a more open and inviting atmosphere.  
- I leaned a bit forward to show interest in the conversation and to make the interviewee give the feeling of being listened to. (0:05)  
- I often used open hand gestures and expressed with body language my interest and passion for the topic. (0:28)  
- Compared to last week's interviews, I also rotated my body so that our knees were diagonally facing each other. It makes a good mix of being open and not intimidating.  
- In Addition to the body language, I kept eye contact, kept smiling and added active listening techniques such as nodding (3:40) and adding comments to his thoughts through the interview to have a more engaging conversation.

### Evaluation {#evaluation-1}

- The interview felt very engaging and from the video you can tell that Ivo was relaxed and enjoyed talking about his interests.  
- I can also see from my body language that I have a far more confident appearance compared to last week's interviews.  
- As a point of improvement, I could have followed up on some of the answers with more questions to get a deeper understanding of the topic.  
  - For example at 2:30, I didn't understand what Ivo was saying. Even though I asked him to elaborate, I didn't dig deeper into the topic and didn't let him explain it in more detail. Instead, I moved on to the next question.  
- The interview also fell a bit short as I was too focused on body language and getting through the questions. I should have let Ivo talk more about his experiences and interests.

## Case Work (4 hours) {#case-work-(4-hours)}

In the beginning of the week, we started with a kick-off interview with the client for the "Find the right present" case. After thorough interview preparation and research, we conducted the interview with the client to get a better understanding of the project and the client's vision.

### Interview Preparation {#interview-preparation}

[documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q2t_hYTG3ePnwD53cFsZsa9ZWbOIaoRpZPJD8aqlMQ0/edit?usp=sharing)

As preparation for the interview, we discussed the case and the questions we would ask. We also prepared a list of questions that we would ask the client to get a better understanding of the case. We structured the interview in two major parts and prepared questions that give us a better understanding of the following issues:

1. Understanding the vision of the project  
     
   - What is the goal of the project?  
   - What are the problems of the client?  
   - What are the constraints of the project?  
   - What should the "system-to-be" look like?

   

2. Mapping the territory  
     
   - Who are the stakeholders? Who will be the users of the product?  
   - What is the "sytem-as-is"?  
   - Are there any existing similar solutions?  
   - What kind of solution has the client in mind?

For preparation of mapping the territory, we started with a brainstorming session where we researched about similar projects and solutions. We found various services that offer different solutions for finding the right present. Here are some examples:

- [GiftAdvisor](https://www.giftadvisor.com/)  
- [Giftruly](https://giftruly.com/)  
- [Amazon Registry and Gifting](https://www.amazon.com/registries)

Based on the research, we could give some examples to the client and ask for a direction of the project.

### Interview with Hans {#interview-with-hans}

Video Recording: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHo8EOdgJqE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHo8EOdgJqE)

Duration: 43 min

[Detailed Summary Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dCFEPMZBxcwUb2JKvwBVTlX0FZ6Sobcm9bNCf_jzGcc/edit?usp=sharing)

Following key points could be extracted from the interview:

The Client's Project Idea:

- The system aims to suggest personalized gifts by analyzing user preferences and contextual information.  
- The idea arose from the clients dissatisfaction with generic and bland gift-giving and the desire for more meaningful exchanges between people.

Users and Data Collection:

- Users input information about themselves and the recipient, such as age, gender, interests, past gifts, and preferences.  
- The system would also collect contextual data, like the occasion and relationship to the recipient.

Recommendation Engine:

- Suggests gifts based on the collected data, taking into account factors like uniqueness, relevance, and personal significance, possibly utilizing AI.  
- Can offer a range of options based on budget and occasion.

Budget Constraints:

- A budget of 100 thousand euros is available, with the possibility of additional funding.

Next Steps:

- For the rest of this and the next week, we will need to research existing gift recommendation platforms to identify gaps and opportunities.  
- The team will also explore research about the psychology of insights on gift-giving.

# Week 3 {#week-3-1}

The third week was focused on experimenting with new interview techniques such as a police style interview. We also started to work on the case by understanding the project vision and doing market research. Furthermore, we started to prepare for stakeholder interviews.

## Personal Practice (3 hours) {#personal-practice-(3-hours)}

In the third week, we continued to experiment with different interview techniques. In contrast to the previous weeks, I tried to use a more direct and confrontational interview style to see the reaction of the interviewee.

### Interview with Yutong {#interview-with-yutong}

Duration: 6min

Focus: "Police style" interview about giving and receiving gifts

Video Recording: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a12sF9fDWUOvgIzM02TQWjyqH82PV8wW/view?usp=sharing)

#### Experiments {#experiments-5}

During the interview, I tried to keep a rather confrontational way of interviewing. Similar to last week, I focused a lot on the body language and

- In contrast to last week's interview, where I was sitting next or diagonally to the interviewee, I sat in a way that I was facing Yutong directly. This should give the interview a more confrontational and serious atmosphere.  
- I leaned forward and crossed my arms to show that I am interested in the conversation but also to keep a serious posture.  
- I tried to keep a more serious facial expression, keep eye contact and kept my voice tone more serious and direct.  
- Towards the end of the interview I stopped the confrontational style and interviewed Yutong in a more relaxed way to see how she would react to the change in tone.

#### Evaluation {#evaluation-2}

- Especially in the first part of the interview, I could see that Yutong was a bit nervous and kept having a serious facial expression. (0:10)  
  - Her answers were more short and direct and she didn't elaborate much on her answers.  
- As I gradually released the serious tension of the interview, I noticed that Yutong also got more relaxed. (4:00\~)  
  - She started to smile more, was more engaged in the interview and also tried to elaborate on her answers more.  
- Through the experiment, I could confirm that depending on the body language and tone of the interviewer, the interviewee will adapt to the situation and will affect the quality of the interview.

## Case Work (5 hours) {#case-work-(5-hours)}

After the kick-off interview with the client last week and started to map out the territory of the case, we started to organize our project. Following topics have been discussed and worked on:

### Understanding the Project Vision {#understanding-the-project-vision}

Understanding the vision of the project is crucial to get a better understanding of the project and the client's expectations. Based on the kick-off interview with our client we solidified our  project vision.

The vision of the project is to create a platform that helps people to find the right present for someone. The recommendation should be based on the interests, preferences, occasion and the relationship between the giver and the receiver. Time and budget constraints such as potential stakeholders were also discussed.

Since the project is about gift giving, the users could be anyone who wants to give a gift to someone. Anyone in our friends and family could be a potential stakeholder. This opened up the possibility to gather information from friends and family to get a better understanding of the user's needs.

### Market Research {#market-research}

To understand the system-as-is, we started to further research the market and the competitors to get a better understanding of the market. After looking at several competitors, we focused our research on two main competitors that are most similar to our project.

Although the competitors offer similar services, they lack some features that could be improved in our project. For example, the competitors don't offer a personalized gift recommendation based on the relationship between the giver and the receiver. This could be a unique selling point for our project. Furthermore, the newest AI technologies could be used to improve the recommendation engine and offer more personalized gift suggestions.

### Stakeholder Interviews {#stakeholder-interviews}

Besides Hans, our main client, we started to plan interviews with potential users of the platform. As a first step, we started to compile a list of questions we could ask our users that can give us a better understanding of the user's needs and expectations.

As an initial step, simple questions were prepared. The initial questions only focused on things that only asked about how frequently the interviewee would use or how much privacy they value in such an app. After a review with Ada, the questions were refined in a way that we can get a better understanding of what kind of struggles the stakeholder has when giving and receiving gifts, thus giving us insight into how we could solve the issues with our solution.

Following questions have been prepared:

* Experience with gift giving?  
  * Have you received / given a gift that you/someone did / didn’t like?  
* Have you ever felt difficulties when buying gifts?  
* How would you ask someone what kind of gifts they want?  
* Would you use the app to get more personalized gifts?  
* What kind of personal information / factors do you consider when buying gifts?  
  * Budget  
  * Relationship  
  * Occasion  
  * Interests  
  * Gender  
* What would you expect as an output of an app that chooses gifts for you  
  * Should it be multiple options  
  * Actual amazon links?  
  * Just ideas that could inspire you  
* How unique / personal should these gifts be?  
* Do you value the uniqueness or general likability of the present?  
* We have a function where users can rate gifts they’ve received.  
* Would you be fine with sharing information about present ideas to the public or do you prefer it to be private?

# Week 4 & 5 {#week-4-&-5-1}

In the fourth and fifth week, we started to implement other requirements engineering techniques such as surveying and prototyping. We also started stakeholder interviews to better understand the users' problems and how we could find a solution for them. Based on the interview and survey results, I could do a personal experiment with Guillermo by comparing the information of both techniques. Furthermore, we dig deeper into the psychological aspects of gift giving by reading the book "The Psychology of Gift Giving" by Bernd Stauss.

## Case Work (12 hours) {#case-work-(12-hours)}

### Stakeholder Interviews {#stakeholder-interviews-1}

After we prepared the questions for the stakeholder interviews last week, we started to conduct the interviews with potential users of the system. Each of the team members conducted interviews with several people from friends and family who are from different nationalities, age groups and backgrounds. We collected interview answers from around 50 people and analyzed the data to get a better understanding of the user needs.

#### General Insights {#general-insights}

Many interviewees expressed that they enjoy the experience of giving gifts, but they often encounter challenges when it comes to selecting the right ones, particularly for individuals with diverse interests or for those they do not know well.

When considering gift options, common factors that interviewees take into account include the recipient's interests, the nature of their relationship, the occasion for the gift, and their budget. While some individuals consider gender in their selection process, others do not find it to be a crucial factor.

Regarding app usage, a significant number of interviewees expressed interest in using an application that provides personalized gift suggestions, especially during important events such as birthdays and holidays. Privacy emerged as a concern for some users, while others felt comfortable sharing gift ideas publicly.

#### Preferences for App Features {#preferences-for-app-features}

Interviewees prefer apps that offer multiple gift options along with links for purchasing these gifts. They value inspiration and creative ideas more than direct purchase links. Additionally, when choosing gifts, they tend to favor practical and thoughtful options. Some interviewees are open to seeing advertisements if the app is free, while others would be willing to pay a small fee for a well-functioning application. Although the uniqueness of gifts is important, interviewees often prioritize the likability of the gifts.

#### Common Interests of Interviewees {#common-interests-of-interviewees}

Most interviewees showed a strong interest in receiving personalized gift suggestions and preferred to have multiple options presented to them rather than a single recommendation. Many emphasized the importance of privacy, expressing a desire to keep their gift choices and history confidential. Practicality and thoughtfulness were also highly valued traits in gift selections. It was noted that the app would primarily be used during key events like birthdays and holidays. Finally, interviewees favored receiving inspiration and ideas over direct links to purchase gifts.

### Survey {#survey}

To further increase the sample size the team also started to prepare a survey that we could send to a larger group of people. The survey was prepared with the same questions as the interviews and was sent to a group of about 20 people. We could find some statistical insights from the survey that helped us to understand the user needs better.

For example, we could confirm that most people received a gift before that they didn't like. This confirms the need for a system that helps to find the right present for someone.

Another insight from the survey was that relationship and interests were the major factors when choosing a gift. In contrast, gender plays a minor role in the decision-making process.

#### Disadvantages of Surveys {#disadvantages-of-surveys}

While survey taking has advantages such as reaching a larger audience and collecting quantitative data, it also has some disadvantages. For example, the survey results can be biased or mislead by the way the questions are formulated. Schuman, H., & Presser \[2\] explores how the framing of questions can influence respondents' answers and overall survey effectiveness. For example, we used an absolute scale for the question for determining the importance of factors when buying gifts. Each respondent had to rate the importance of each factor on a scale from 1 to 5, although there were no clear definitions of what each number means. This could lead to different interpretations of the scale and thus to biased results.

Also, the quality of the data can suffer from the lack of context and the inability to ask follow-up questions. This can lead to misinterpretation of the data and the inability to get a deeper understanding of the user's needs. Baker, R., & Brick, J. M. \[3\] discusses how different modes (telephone, face-to-face, online) impact the quality of data collected. The quality of the data can be also influenced by the length of the survey. Galesic, M., Bosnjak \[4\] investigates how longer surveys can lead to fatigue, negatively impacting the quality of responses.

For many open-ended questions, we noticed that the respondents didn't elaborate on their answers, only gave very short answers or didn't answer at all. Especially for questions coming up at the end of the survey, the respondents were more likely to give low quality answers or skip the question.

Further investigation about the effects of survey taking will be conducted in the personal practice section.

### Psychology of Gift Giving {#psychology-of-gift-giving}

For the case work, we started to read the book "The Psychology of Gift Giving" by Bernd Stauss \[5\]. The book explores the psychological aspects of gift giving and receiving and how it can influence relationships and social interactions. We could find some interesting insights that helped us to understand the user needs better and how we could design the system to meet these needs.

Studies have outlined six principles that define the perfect gift: it should illustrate genuine sacrifice by the giver, aim solely for the recipient's happiness, be a luxury, be appropriately distinctive for the recipient, provide an element of surprise, and ultimately please the recipient. Sherry et al. (1983) \[6\] describes the gift exchange process in three stages: gestation (choosing the gift), presentation (giving the gift), and reformulation (evaluating the relationship afterward).

The team discussed the key insights from the book and how we could apply them to the case. For example, we could use the principles of the perfect gift to design the recommendation engine and the user interface of the system. We could also use the gift exchange process to design the user flow of the system and how the users interact with the system.

## Personal Practice (8 hours) {#personal-practice-(8-hours)}

In context of the case work, I conducted several interviews with potential users of the system. With the interview questions that we prepared with the team in the last week, I could ask several people from my family and friends group about their experiences with gift giving and what kind of problems they have with finding the right present.

As a personal experiment, Guillermo and I interviewed the same stakeholder who already participated in the survey. We looked at each other's interview results and compared the information to the survey results. We could find some interesting insights about the differences between the two techniques.

### Interview with Erina (changed the name for privacy reasons) {#interview-with-erina-(changed-the-name-for-privacy-reasons)}

Duration: 22min

Focus: Giving and receiving gifts

Video Recording: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dM-8rF3mzHrXkWvbMmy6rxaQUa_eTbjW/view?usp=drive_link)

Interview results are summarized in the [appendix](#appendix-interview-results-for-survey-interview-comparison).

#### Added techniques learned from previous interviews {#added-techniques-learned-from-previous-interviews}

* From experience of the previous interviews, I made sure to conduct a long interview and give the interviewee enough time to elaborate on her answers.  
* During the interview, I maintained a more relaxed and friendly atmosphere to make the interviewee feel comfortable and open up about her experiences.  
* If I get the feeling that the interviewee is holding back, I try to follow up with more specific questions to get a deeper understanding of the topic.

### Comparison of interview quality with survey results {#comparison-of-interview-quality-with-survey-results}

As already explored in the [previous section](#disadvantages-of-surveys), we will explore the differences between the survey and interview results. I will compare the information collected by Guillermo in the survey and his interview and will compare it.

#### Comparison of Guillermo's interview with Samuel's survey response {#comparison-of-guillermo's-interview-with-samuel's-survey-response}

See [appendix](#appendix-interview-results-for-survey-interview-comparison) for full interview results.

In the survey, Samuel answered mostly similar or same as the interview results. For example, for a gift he liked, he mentions receiving a PS4 from his parents. In the interview, he elaborated on the gift, mentioning that it was a special occasion because it was just released and he really wanted it. Although the answers were consistent, the interview provided more detailed information about the gift and the emotions associated with it.  
You can notice that the survey answers fall short in capturing the full context of Samuel's experiences.

In the survey, Samuel mentioned that he didn't receive any gifts that he didn't like in the past. However, in the interview, he mentioned that he received clothes from a group of friends that he didn't like. This inconsistency shows that the survey might not capture all the details and nuances of the interview.

In the interview, Samuel also mentions that he misunderstood the question about the importance of interests when choosing a gift. He thought it meant the emotional interest the giver has to the receiver. This misunderstanding was not captured in the survey. This shows that depending on how the questions are formulated, the respondents might interpret them differently.

Finally, in the interview you can provide additional information about his values when asked about factors that are important for gift giving. For example, he mentioned that the relationship with the person is the most important factor when choosing a gift. This information was not captured in the survey. Through this information, you can get a better understanding of the stakeholders likert scale answers.

#### Comparison of my interview with Erina's survey response {#comparison-of-my-interview-with-erina's-survey-response}

Additionally, I could also get some insightful results from my own interviews. There was a difference in the correctness of the information between the survey and the interview. For example, in the survey, Erina answered the first simple question "What is the best gift you've ever received", that she received a watch from her mother. Although in the interview, she answered that it was a necklace received from her mother. In both answers, she mentioned that she received the gift from her mother 5 years ago as a birthday gift, so it was at the same time. Maybe she received two gifts, maybe she was not present at the moment when she answered the question. This example shows that there will be inconsistencies in the data collected from different techniques and that it is important to cross-check the information.

#### Conclusion of survey and interview comparison {#conclusion-of-survey-and-interview-comparison}

The comparison of the survey and interview results showed that the interview provided more detailed and nuanced information compared to the survey. The interview allowed for more in-depth exploration of the stakeholder's experiences and emotions, providing a richer understanding of their needs and preferences. Furthermore it can resolve misunderstandings that might occur in the survey. The survey, on the other hand, provided more quantitative data and allowed for a larger sample size, but lacked the depth and context of the interview.

# Week 6 & 7 {#week-6-&-7-1}

## Personal Practice: Literature Study (18 hours) {#personal-practice:-literature-study-(18-hours)}

For the literature study, I focused on the following topic: Requirements Engineering in Agile Project. A concise report is available in the assignments.

## Case Work (8 hours) {#case-work-(8-hours)}

For the sixth week, all the gathered information and insights from the interviews and research were compiled into a report and a presentation. Furthermore a simple prototype as a proposed solution has been created. Prior to the final presentation, the team received feedback from our supervisor Hans and made some final adjustments to the presentation.

### Presentation {#presentation}

The team prepared a presentation that summarized the key insights from the interviews and research. We split the team into multiple smaller groups to work on different parts of the presentation. The presentation was structured in the following way:

1. The 12 Jungian Archetypes vs Gift-giver types  
2. Gathered insights from interviews and surveys  
3. Problems with gift giving and receiving  
4. What makes a good gift  
5. Current solutions  
6. Non-IT solutions  
7. Prototype of proposed solution

I was responsible for preparing the slides about the problems of receiving and giving gifts and the proposed solution.

I have prepared following key points for the presentation:

#### Problems With Gift Finding {#problems-with-gift-finding}

Finding and giving gifts can present several challenges. One major issue is the emotional pressure and perfectionism associated with selecting the "perfect" gift, which can create anxiety for the giver. This pressure is especially pronounced when the giver does not know the recipient well, making it difficult to choose something suitable.

Additionally, social and cultural obligations can complicate the gift-giving process. In many cultures, there is an expectation to give gifts, which can transform the act from a joyful gesture into a sense of duty.

Moreover, gift-givers often exhibit a bias by overestimating how much a gift will be appreciated. In reality, recipients frequently place greater value on the sentiment behind the gift rather than its material worth.

#### Problems With Gift Receiving {#problems-with-gift-receiving}

Receiving gifts can also pose several challenges. One significant issue is the potential for disappointment and misinterpretation. Unwanted gifts can lead to feelings of frustration or even insult, while impersonal gifts may convey unintended messages about the giver's feelings or intentions.

Another problem is the obligation to reciprocate. There is often a social pressure to return a gift of equal value, which can create stress for the recipient.

Additionally, recipients may experience anxiety regarding how their reaction to the gift will be perceived. This can lead to pressure to express gratitude, even if they are ultimately disappointed with the gift.

### Final Feedback from Hans before Presentation {#final-feedback-from-hans-before-presentation}

In a final meeting with the supervisor, we presented an overview of our findings. Hans provided feedback on the presentation, emphasizing the importance of backing up our claims with data and research. We took his feedback into account and created graphs and charts from interview and survey data. We also added references to the literature study to support our arguments. Final adjustments were made to the presentation based on Hans' feedback.

### Prototype {#prototype}

Our team developed a personalized AI-driven chat tool to enhance the gift-giving experience for both givers and recipients. By understanding the preferences and characteristics of recipients, we aim to create tailored recommendations that improve gift selection.

Using insights from stakeholder interviews, surveys, and market research, we address common challenges in gift-giving. We utilize Jungian archetypes to create distinct user personas, which helps personalize gift suggestions without overwhelming users. Key features of our tool include:

- Archetype-Based Suggestions: The tool identifies gift-giver types based on relationship, occasion, and past experiences, aligning gifts with the recipient's archetype.  
- Personalized Messages: It assists users in crafting messages that enhance the emotional impact of their gifts.  
- Price Comparisons and Suggestions: Users receive multiple gift options and price comparisons, allowing for informed decision-making.

Our research indicated that givers prefer unique yet generally liked gifts. We are addressing gaps in existing solutions by integrating features like real-time price comparisons and user ratings.

While our prototype confirmed the value of archetype-based personalization, we recognize the need to incorporate cultural and demographic data for broader applicability. Future iterations will expand the archetype framework to include culturally specific preferences. Overall, our approach shows promise for creating a meaningful and intuitive gift-selection process.

# Week 8 {#week-8-1}

The final week was focused on the final presentation and report. The final presentation was prepared and presented to the client. The final report was compiled and submitted.

## Personal Practice {#personal-practice}

Since it was the end of the term and exams were on the line, no personal practice was conducted.

## Case Work {#case-work}

The final presentation was prepared and presented to the client. The presentation summarized the key insights from the interviews and research, the problems with gift giving and receiving, and the proposed solution. The client pointed out some gaps in our presentation, for example, the lack of a connection of the jungian archetypes to the final solution. There were no mentions of how the archetypes were used in the prototype. For further improvement, we could have included more details about how we incorporated the archetypes into the design of the prototype's recommendation engine. Since it was the end of the course, the project was concluded and the final report was submitted.

# Reflection and Conclusion {#reflection-and-conclusion}

## Personal Practice {#personal-practice-1}

The course was a great experience to learn about requirements engineering techniques and how to apply them in practice. I learned a lot about interview techniques, how body language is an important factor in communication, and how to conduct interviews in a professional manner. I also learned about the advantages and disadvantages of different requirements engineering techniques such as interviews and surveys. Furthermore, through the literature study, I gained insights into how requirements engineering is applied in agile projects and how to adapt to changing requirements. This was a valuable insight for my current and future career being part of an agile team for a large-scale project.

The program gave us a good taste of how to deal with the unknown. In requirements engineering there are no right or wrong answers and there is always the possibility of misunderstanding, not knowing what to ask or how to ask. This course gave us the opportunity to learn how to deal with these uncertainties and how to adapt to changing requirements, eliciting customer needs, and reduce the risk of failure by understanding the human psychology that is prone to noise and biases.

## Case Work {#case-work-1}

The case work was a great opportunity to apply interview techniques and requirements engineering methods in practice. We could gather real life experience in conducting interviews, analyzing data, and preparing a solution for a real-world problem. Although the solution didn't seem to satisfy the client's needs, the feedback we received was valuable for our learning process. Especially the feedback of making sure to back up our claims with data and research and add logical connections between the findings and the proposed solution was an important insight for future projects.

Reflecting on the 8 weeks of case work, I would have liked to have more time and organization to have more sophisticated work between team members. Since the team consisted of 10 members, it was sometimes difficult to coordinate the work and make sure that everyone is on the same page without a proper team structure and roles. Also, as everyone had other courses, assignments, work, and exams, it was difficult to organize meetings and allocate work properly. This was also a reason why we couldn't make the final presentation and report as good as it could have been, especially during a time where everyone was busy with exams and other assignments.
