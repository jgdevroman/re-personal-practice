# Week 3 

## Interviews

In the third week, we continued to experiment with different interview techniques. In contrast to the previous weeks, I tried to use a more direct and confrontational interview style to see the reaction of the interviewee. 

### Yutong

Duration: 6min

Focus: "Police style" interview about giving and receiving gifts

#### Experiments

During the interview, I tried to keep a rather confrontational way of interviewing. Similar to last week, I focused a lot on the body language and 

- In contrast to last weeks interview, where I was sitting next or diagonally to the interviewee, I sat in a way that I was facing Yutong directly. This should give the interview a more confrontational and serious atmosphere.
- I leaned forward and crossed my arms to show that I am interested in the conversation but also to keep a serious posture.
- I tried to keep a more serious facial expression, keep eye contact and kept my voice tone more serious and direct.
- Towards the end of the interview I stopped the confrontational style and interviewed Yutong in a more relaxed way to see how she would react to the change in tone.

#### Evaluation

- Especially in the first part of the interview, I could see that Yutong was a bit nervous and kept having a serious facial expression. (0:10)
  - Her answers were more short and direct and she didn't elaborate much on her answers.
- As I gradually released the serious tension of the interview, I noticed that Yutong also got more relaxed. (4:00~)
  - She started to smile more, was more engaged inn the interview and also tried to elaborate on her answers more. 
- Through the experiment, could confirm that depending on the body language and tone of the interviewer, the interviewee will adapt to the situation and will affect the quality of the interview.
