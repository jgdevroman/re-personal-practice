# Week 3 

## Interviews (3 hours)

In the third week, we continued to experiment with different interview techniques. In contrast to the previous weeks, I tried to use a more direct and confrontational interview style to see the reaction of the interviewee. 

### Yutong

Duration: 6min

Focus: "Police style" interview about giving and receiving gifts

#### Experiments

During the interview, I tried to keep a rather confrontational way of interviewing. Similar to last week, I focused a lot on the body language and 

- In contrast to last weeks interview, where I was sitting next or diagonally to the interviewee, I sat in a way that I was facing Yutong directly. This should give the interview a more confrontational and serious atmosphere.
- I leaned forward and crossed my arms to show that I am interested in the conversation but also to keep a serious posture.
- I tried to keep a more serious facial expression, keep eye contact and kept my voice tone more serious and direct.
- Towards the end of the interview I stopped the confrontational style and interviewed Yutong in a more relaxed way to see how she would react to the change in tone.

#### Evaluation

- Especially in the first part of the interview, I could see that Yutong was a bit nervous and kept having a serious facial expression. (0:10)
  - Her answers were more short and direct and she didn't elaborate much on her answers.
- As I gradually released the serious tension of the interview, I noticed that Yutong also got more relaxed. (4:00~)
  - She started to smile more, was more engaged inn the interview and also tried to elaborate on her answers more. 
- Through the experiment, could confirm that depending on the body language and tone of the interviewer, the interviewee will adapt to the situation and will affect the quality of the interview.

## Case Work (5 hours)

After the kick-off interview with the client last week and started to map out the territory of the case, we started to organize our project. Following topics have been discussed and worked on:

### Understanding the Project Vision

Understanding the vision of the project is crucial to get a better understanding of the project and the client's expectations. Based on the kick-off interview with our client we solidified our  project vision.

The vision of the project is to create a platform that helps people to find the right present for someone. The recommendation should be based on the interests, preferences, occasion and the relationship between the giver and the receiver.

### Market Research

To understand the system-as-is, we started to further research the market and the competitors to get a better understanding of the market. After looking at several competitors, we focused our research on two main competitors that are most similar to our project.

Here are some insights from our research:

#### Giftster

* Platform: Allows users to create and share wish lists.  
* Features:  
  * Create wish lists for various events (birthdays, holidays).  
  * Share lists with groups or keep them private.  
  * Add gifts manually or fetch item information from web links.  
  * Rank items by preference and manage gift preferences.  
  * Avoid duplicate gifts by showing which items have been purchased.  
  * Collaborative features for group members to suggest gift ideas.  
* Limitations:  
  * Lacks innovative features like AI.  
  * Functions mainly as a gift list organizer without providing new or unique gift ideas.

#### Giftit

* Platform: Uses an LLM-powered bot to find out the recipient’s likes and dislikes.  
* Features:  
  * Anonymously gathers information about the recipient’s preferences.  
  * Compiles a list of possible products based on the recipient’s interests.  
* Limitations:  
  * Execution is not always accurate, especially for specific or uncommon gifts.  
  * Reduces the surprise factor as the recipient may already know the suggested gifts.  
  * Privacy concerns due to the nature of data collection.

### Stakeholder Interviews

Besides Hans, our main client, we started to plan doing interviews with potential users of the platform. As a first step, we started to compile a list of questions we could ask our users that can give us a better understanding of the user's needs and expectations.

The questions are structured in a way that we can get a better understanding of the "system-to-be", thus what kind issues our potential users have with finding the right present and how we can solve them.

Following questions have been prepared:

* Experience with gift giving?  
  * Have you received / given a gift that you/someone did / didn’t like?  
* Have you ever felt difficulties when buying gifts?  
* How would you ask someone what kind of gifts they want?  
* Would you use the app to get more personalized gifts?  
* What kind of personal information / factors do you consider when buying gifts?  
  * Budget  
  * Relationship  
  * Occasion  
  * Interests  
  * Gender  
* What would you expect as an output of an app that chooses gifts for you  
  * Should it be multiple options  
  * Actual amazon links?  
  * Just ideas that could inspire you  
* How unique / personal should these gifts be?  
* Do you value the uniqueness or general likability of the present?  
* We have a function where users can rate gifts they’ve received.   
* Would you be fine with sharing information about present ideas to the public or do you prefer it to be private?
