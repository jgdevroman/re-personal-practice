# Week 6 & 7

## Personal Practice: Literature Study (18 hours)

For the literature study, I focused on the following topic: Requirements Engineering in Agile Project. A concise report is available in the assignment.

## Case Work (8 hours)

For the sixth week, all the gathered information and insights from the interviews and research were compiled into a report and a presentation. The presentation was prepared and presented to the client. The feedback from the client gave good insights into how we could have improved the proposed solution.
