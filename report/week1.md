# Requirements Engineering Personal Practice Report

Roman Körnig

# Week 1

In the first week we started practicing simple interviews. At first we conducted 4 short interviews where we could get used to interviewing and get to know our team members better. Later, we added 2 more substantial interviews that were also video recorded and we actively experimented with some interview techniques.

We also started to work on the case by setting up a kick-off interview with the client.

## Personal Practice (5 hours)

As a warmup, we started with short interviews to get to know each other better and get a feeling for the interview process. In the two longer interviews, we added some experiments to improve our interviewing skills.

### Yutong (short interview)

Duration: 5min

Focus: What is a good team member

Notes:

- I was still nervous about interviewing in general as it was my first time and wasn't prepared for the interview.
- Had difficulties in what kind of questions to ask.

### Ilia (short interview)

Duration: 5min

Focus: What is a good team member

Notes:

- Tried make the interviewee speak by asking for real life experience.

### Guillermo (short interview)

Duration: 5min

Focus: What is a good team member

Notes:

- As it was difficult to get straight into the topic, I started the interview by adding an intro talk.
- For example, giving examples of core team member values such as punctuality and humbleness.

### Kyle (short interview)

Duration: 5min

Focus: What is a good team member

Notes:

- Suggested interviewee to elaborate on thoughts by summarizing and adding my interpretations.
- Asked about examples in the past.

### Ada (long interview)

Duration: 13min

Focus: What is a good team member

#### Experiments:

- Since there is more time, I tried get into the topic by firstly making general questions about the interviewees background and her experience with team work to break the ice and get to know the interviewee
  - For example, asking about the interviewees past project she has been involved in (0:30)
- Based on the background of the interviewee I could make the interviewee elaborate on her values backed with real life examples
  - Didn’t just focus on good examples but also asked about negative examples in the past that backed up the interviewees reasons (7:00)
- Made short summaries of the interviewees answers to make sure I understood the interviewee correctly (8:30)

Self reflection after reviewing the video:

- Often avoided eye contact due to nervousness and struggling to find the right questions.
  - Especially when I was thinking about the next question I was not looking at the interviewee
- I was concerned too much about time keeping. I should have been more present in the moment and focused on the interviewee.
- During the interview I got into the flow and was more relaxed towards the end of the interview also thanks to Ada. I was able to get a good understanding of the interviewee and her values about team work.

### Tom (long interview)

Duration: 12min

Focus: What is a good team member

Video Recording: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-8loB8RHAX_mBngdIF2KAxQteJYmIkcp/view?usp=sharing

#### Experiments:

- Went with a similar approach to Ada’s interview
- As the interviewee was sometimes vague with his answers I tried to get more information by rephrasing and directing the question to a specific point (5:30)
- Asked follow up questions that are relative to the expectations that the interviewee has. E.g. why a team member would have less value if the expected skill set in a team is high, compared to values that are important if the expected skill set is low. (8:30)
- Tried to be more present by doing more active listening like nodding or repeating what the interviewee said to show that I am listening.

#### Evaluation

- Still struggling with eye contact and finding the right questions.
- The active listening was better than in the previous interview and I was able to make the interviewee talk.
- I asked some questions that were a bit too hard to understand and caused some confusion. I should have been more clear with my questions.

## Case Work (2 hours)

After a discussion with our team members, we voted for the "Find the right present" case as our first choice. We then set up a kick-off interview with the client. The kickoff-interview has been initiated by sending [an outreach email](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AJccQjRAECHxE6ryvtzNYFwTzanImXTt16Eauh7SMzw/edit?tab=t.0) to the client. The email contained a brief introduction of the team and the purpose of the interview.

Finally, we discussed which role each team member would take in the case and what kind of questions we would ask in the upcoming interviews. I was assigned the role of the backup interviewer to support the main interviewer in the interviews. It could happen that the interview questions derail and the backup interviewer can step in to get the interview back on track.
