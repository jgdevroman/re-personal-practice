# Week 2

In the second week, we reflected on the last week's interviews and added new techniques to our interviews to make the interviewee feel more at ease. In the interview, we role played as me being a personal shopper someone who is looking for a new phone.  
For the case, we conducted the kick-off interview with the client and started to work on the case by setting up a plan for the following weeks.

## Interviews (4 hours)

During this interview session, I implemented a the interview and communication technique that allows the interviewee to feel more at ease. As an experiment, I used a body language that was more open and inviting which let the interviewee feel more comfortable to talk about their experiences. Further details can be found in the Experiments section in the interview with Yvo.

As a warmup I started with an unrecorded interview with Jakub. We then conducted a recorded interview with Ivo where we experimented with the body language techniques.

### Jakub

Duration: 5min

Focus: Personal shopper for a new phone

Notes:

- It was a warmup interview to get used to the new techniques.
- I tried to use an open body language to express a more open and inviting atmosphere.
- Based on the feedback from previous sessions, I tried to make more eye contact and not to look away while thinking about the next question.

### Yvo

Duration: 5min

#### Experiments

[Research from Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/news/2013/01/15/dont-read-my-lips-body-language-trumps-face-conveying-intense-emotions) [1] shows that body language is a key factor in communication and conveys emotions more effectively than facial expressions.
In experiments of the research, participants were better at identifying emotions based solely on body language compared to facial cues, suggesting that body movements carry substantial communicative weight in social interactions.

- Same as Jakub, I tried to use an open body language to express a more open and inviting atmosphere.
- I leaned a bit forward to show interest in the conversation and to make the interviewee give the feel being listened. (0:05)
- I often used open hand gestures and expressed with body language my interest and passion for the topic. (0:28)
- Compared to the last weeks interviews, I also rotated my body so that our knees were diagonally facing each other. It makes a good mix of being open and not intimidating.
- Additional to the body language, I was keeping eye contact, kept smiling and added active listening techniques such as nodding (3:40) and adding comments to his thoughts through the interview to have a more engaging conversation.

#### Evaluation

- The interview felt very engaging and form the video you can tell that Ivo was relaxed and enjoyed talking about his interests.
- I can also see from my body language that I have a far more confident appearance compared to the last weeks interviews.
- As a point of improvement, I could have followed up on some of the answers with more questions to get a deeper understanding of the topic.
  - For example at 2:30, I didn't understand what Ivo was saying. Even though I asked him to elaborate, I didn't dig deeper into the topic and didn't let him explain it in more detail. Instead, I moved on to the next question.
- The interview also fell a bit short as I was too focused on the body language and getting through the questions. I should have let Ivo talk more about his experiences and interests.

## Case Work (4 hours)

In the beginning of the week, we started with a kick-off interview with the client for the "Find the right present" case. After a thorough interview preparation and research, we conducted the interview with the client to get a better understanding of the project and the client's vision.

### Interview Preparation

[documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q2t_hYTG3ePnwD53cFsZsa9ZWbOIaoRpZPJD8aqlMQ0/edit?usp=sharing)

As preparation for the interview, we discussed the case and the questions we would ask. We also prepared a list of questions that we would ask the client to get a better understanding of the case.
We structured the interview in two major parts and prepared questions that give us a better understanding of the following issues:

1. Understanding the vision of the project

   - What is the goal of the project?
   - What are the problems of the client?
   - What are the constrains of the project?
   - How should the "system-to-be" look like?

2. Mapping the territory
   - Who are the stakeholders? Who will be the users of the product?
   - What is the "sytem-as-is"?
   - Are there any existing similar solutions?
   - What kind of solution has the client in mind?

For a preparation of mapping the territory, we started with a brainstorming session where we researched about similar project and solutions. We found various services that offer different solutions for finding the right present. Here are some examples:

- [GiftAdvisor](https://www.giftadvisor.com/)
- [Giftruly](https://giftruly.com/)
- [Amazon Registry and Gifting](https://www.amazon.com/registries)

Based on the research, we could give some examples to the client and ask for a direction of the project.

### Interview with Hans

Duration: 43 min

Following key points could be extracted from the interview:

The Client's Project Idea:

- The system aims to suggest personalized gifts by analyzing user preferences and contextual information.
- The idea arose from the clients dissatisfaction with generic and bland gift-giving and the desire for more meaningful exchanges between people.

Users and Data Collection:

- Users input information about themselves and the recipient, such as age, gender, interests, past gifts, and preferences.
- The system would also collect contextual data, like the occasion and relationship to the recipient.

Recommendation Engine:

- Suggests gifts based on the collected data, taking into account factors like uniqueness, relevance, and personal significance, possibly utilizing AI.
- Can offer a range of options based on budget and occasion.

Budget Constraints:

- A budget of 100 thousand euros is available, with the possibility of additional funding.

Next Steps:

- For the rest of this and the next week, we will need do to research existing gift recommendation platforms to identify gaps and opportunities.
- The team will also explore researches about the psychology on insights on gift-giving.
