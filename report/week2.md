# Week 2

In the second week, we reflected on the last week's interviews and added new techniques to our interviews to make the interviewee feel more at ease. In the interview, we role played as me being a personal shopper someone who is looking for a new phone.  
For the case, we conducted the kick-off interview with the client and started to work on the case by setting up a plan for the following weeks.


## Interviews

During this interview session, I implemented a the interview and communication technique that allows the interviewee to feel more at ease. As an experiment, I used a body language that was more open and inviting which let the interviewee feel more comfortable to talk about their experiences. Further details can be found in the Experiments section in the interview with Yvo.  

As a warmup I started with an unrecorded interview with Jakub. We then conducted a recorded interview with Ivo where we experimented with the body language techniques.


### Jakub

Duration: 5min	

Focus: Personal shopper for a new phone

Notes:
* It was a warmup interview to get used to the new techniques.
* I tried to use an open body language to express a more open and inviting atmosphere. 
* Based on the feedback from previous sessions, I tried to make more eye contact and not to look away while thinking about the next question.

#### Experiments:

[Research from Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/news/2013/01/15/dont-read-my-lips-body-language-trumps-face-conveying-intense-emotions) shows that body language is a key factor in communication and conveys emotions more effectively than facial expressions.
In experiments of the research, participants were better at identifying emotions based solely on body language compared to facial cues, suggesting that body movements carry substantial communicative weight in social interactions.

* Same as Jakub, I tried to use an open body language to express a more open and inviting atmosphere. 
* I leaned a bit forward to show interest in the conversation and to make the interviewee give the feel being listened. (0:05)
* I often used open hand gestures and expressed with body language my interest and passion for the topic. (0:28)
* Compared to the last weeks interviews, I also rotated my body so that our knees were diagonally facing each other. It makes a good mix of being open and not intimidating. 
* Additional to the body language, I was keeping eye contact, kept smiling and added active listening techniques such as nodding (3:40) and adding comments to his thoughts through the interview to have a more engaging conversation.

Self Reflection:
* The interview felt very engaging and form the video you can tell that Ivo was relaxed and enjoyed talking about his interests.
* I can also see from my body language that I have a far more confident appearance compared to the last weeks interviews.
* As a point of improvement, I could have followed up on some of the answers with more questions to get a deeper understanding of the topic.
  * For example at 2:30, I didn't understand what Ivo was saying. Even though I asked him to elaborate, I didn't dig deeper into the topic and didn't let him explain it in more detail. Instead, I moved on to the next question.
* The interview also fell a bit short as I was too focused on the body language and getting through the questions. I should have let Ivo talk more about his experiences and interests.


## Case Work

In the beginning of the week, we started with a kick-off interview with the client for the "Find the right present" case. We directly approached personally and setup a meeting time and place.


### Interview Preparation

As preparation for the interview, we discussed the case and the questions we would ask. We also prepared a list of questions that we would ask the client to get a better understanding of the case.
We structured the interview in two major parts and prepared questions that give us a better understanding of the following issues: 

1. Understanding the vision of the project
   * What is the goal of the project?
   * What are the problems of the client?
   * What are the constrains of the project?
   * How should the "system-to-be" look like?
 
2. Mapping the territory
   * Who are the stakeholders? Who will be the users of the product?
   * What is the "sytem-as-is"? 
   * Are there any existing similar solutions?
   * What kind of solution has the client in mind?
