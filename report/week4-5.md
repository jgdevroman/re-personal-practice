# Week 4-5

In the fourth and fifth week, we started to implement other requirements engineering techniques such as surveying and prototyping. We also started to start stakeholder interviews to better understand the users problems and how we could find a solution for them. Based on the interview and survey results, I could do a personal experiment with Guillermo by comparing the information of both techniques. Furthermore, we digged deeper into the psychological aspects of gift giving by reading the book "The Psychology of Gift Giving" by Bernd Stauss.

## Case Work (12 hours)

### Stakeholder Interviews

After we prepared the questions for the stakeholder interviews in the last week, we started to conduct the interviews with potential users of the system. 
Each of the team members conducted interviews with several people from friends and family who are from different nationality, age group and background. The interview results were collected and analyzed.

Here are some general insights from the interviews:

* Most interviewees enjoy giving gifts but often face challenges in choosing the right ones, especially for people with varied interests or those they donâ€™t know well.
* Many interviewees find it difficult to ask for gift preferences directly, as it can feel impersonal or spoil the surprise.
* Interviewees appreciate personalized gifts that show thoughtfulness and consideration for their interests and preferences.
* Inspiration and ideas are valued over direct purchase links.

### Survey 

To further increase the sample size the team also started to prepare a survey that we could send to a larger group of people. The survey was prepared with the same questions as the interviews and was sent to a group of about 50 people. 

## Personal Practice (8 hours)

In context of the case work, I conducted several interviews with potential users of the system. With the interview questions that we prepared with the team in the last week, I could ask several people from my family and friends group about their experiences with gift giving and what kind of problems they have with finding the right present.
