# Week 4 & 5

In the fourth and fifth week, we started to implement other requirements engineering techniques such as surveying and prototyping. We also started to start stakeholder interviews to better understand the users problems and how we could find a solution for them. Based on the interview and survey results, I could do a personal experiment with Guillermo by comparing the information of both techniques. Furthermore, we digged deeper into the psychological aspects of gift giving by reading the book "The Psychology of Gift Giving" by Bernd Stauss.

## Case Work (12 hours)

### Stakeholder Interviews

After we prepared the questions for the stakeholder interviews in the last week, we started to conduct the interviews with potential users of the system.
Each of the team members conducted interviews with several people from friends and family who are from different nationality, age group and background. The interview results were collected and analyzed.

Here are some general insights from the interviews:

- Most interviewees enjoy giving gifts but often face challenges in choosing the right ones, especially for people with varied interests or those they donâ€™t know well.
- Many interviewees find it difficult to ask for gift preferences directly, as it can feel impersonal or spoil the surprise.
- Interviewees appreciate personalized gifts that show thoughtfulness and consideration for their interests and preferences.
- Inspiration and ideas are valued over direct purchase links.

### Survey

To further increase the sample size the team also started to prepare a survey that we could send to a larger group of people. The survey was prepared with the same questions as the interviews and was sent to a group of about 50 people. We could find some statistical insights from the survey that helped us to understand the user needs better.

For example, we could confirm that most people received a gift before that they didn't like. This confirms the need for a system that helps to find the right present for someone.

Another insight from the survey was that relationship and interests were the major factors when choosing a gift. In contrast, gender plays a minor role in the decision-making process.

#### Disadvantages of Surveys

While survey taking has advantages such as reaching a larger audience and collecting quantitative data, it also has some disadvantages. For example, the survey results can be biased or mislead by the way the questions are formulated. Schuman, H., & Presser [1] explores how the framing of questions can influence respondents' answers and overall survey effectiveness. For example, we used an absolute scale for the question for determining the importance of factors when buying gifts. Each respondent had to rate the importance of each factor on a scale from 1 to 5, although there were no clear definitions of what each number meant. This could lead to different interpretations of the scale and thus to biased results.

Also, the quality of the data can suffer from the lack of context and the inability to ask follow-up questions. This can lead to misinterpretation of the data and the inability to get a deeper understanding of the user's needs. Baker, R., & Brick, J. M. [2] discusses how different modes (telephone, face-to-face, online) impact the quality of data collected. The quality of the data can be also influenced by the length of the survey. Galesic, M., Bosnjak [3] investigates how longer surveys can lead to fatigue, negatively impacting the quality of responses.

For many open ended questions, we noticed that the respondents didn't elaborate on their answers, only gave very short answer or didn't answer at all. Especially for questions coming up at the end of the survey, the respondents were more likely to give low quality answers or skip the question. 

Further investigation about the effects of survey taking will be conducted in the personal practice section.

## Personal Practice (8 hours)

In context of the case work, I conducted several interviews with potential users of the system. With the interview questions that we prepared with the team in the last week, I could ask several people from my family and friends group about their experiences with gift giving and what kind of problems they have with finding the right present.

As a personal experiment, Guillermo and I interviewed the same stakeholder who already participated in the survey. We looked at each others interview result and compared the information to the survey results. We could find some interesting insights about the differences between the two techniques.

### Interview with Erina (changed the name for privacy reasons)

Duration: 22min

Focus: Giving and receiving gifts

* From experience of the previous interviews, I made sure to conduct a long interview and give the interviewee enough time to elaborate on her answers.
* During the interview, I maintained a more relaxed and friendly atmosphere to make the interviewee feel comfortable and open up about her experiences. 
* If I get the feeling that the interviewee is holding back, I tried to follow up with more specific questions to get a deeper understanding of the topic.

### Comparison of interview quality with survey results

As already explored in the [previous section](#disadvantages-of-surveys), we will explore the differences between the survey and interview results. I will compare the information collected by Guillermo in the survey and the his interview and will compare it.

[Part about comparing Guilles results]

Additionally, I could also get some insightful results from my own interviews. There was a difference in the correctness of the information between the survey and the interview. For example, in the survey, Erina answered to the first simple question "What is the best gift you've ever received", that she received a watch from her mother. Although in the interview, she answered that it was a necklace received from her mother. In both answers, she mentioned that she received the gift from her mother 5 years ago as a birthday gift, so it was on the same time. Maybe she received two gifts, maybe she was not present in the moment when she answered the question. This example shows that there will be inconsistencies in the data collected from different techniques and that it is important to cross-check the information.
